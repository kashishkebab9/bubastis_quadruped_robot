# bubastis_quadruped_ros
My Quadruped Robot, Bubastis, simulated on ROS with Jacobian Kinematics.

There are two repositories for this project. This one and one named bubastis_quadruped_support. This is due to my lack of knowledge of github, oh well.

This repository contains all the code I wrote to ensure my math for the kinematics of a mammalian quadruped robot is correct.

Instructions for how you can install and run the simulation yourself will be posted in the future. As of the right now, the math I used for around 99% of this is found in bubastis_backplane.py
