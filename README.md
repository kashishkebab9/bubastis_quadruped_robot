## bubastis_quadruped_ros
# About

My Quadruped Robot, Bubastis, simulated on ROS with Jacobian Kinematics.

There are two repositories for this project. This one and one named bubastis_quadruped_support. This is due to my lack of knowledge of github, oh well.

This repository contains all the code I wrote to ensure my math for the kinematics of a mammalian quadruped robot is correct.

# Pre-Requisites
1. A machine running Ubuntu. Only tested at this point on Ubuntu 16.04.06 LTS (Xenial)
2. ROS Kinetic installed

# Directions for Install  
1. If you don't have a catkin workspace you'll have to generate one:

    hello world
